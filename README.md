# Heart_Attack_Analysis
#### Introduction
This project is focussed on predictingthe probability of heart attack based on people's health conditions and levels of different harmones. Python based logistic regression and decision tree models are developed for achieving a high accuracy in the prediction.

#### Data
12KB data file named 'heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset' is used for developing the model

#### Project Sections
##### 1. Data Cleaning
The data is examined for null values and invalid values. The data is cleansed completely and made ready for further analysis.
##### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
This section is examined for relationships and correlations between variables in the data.
Correlations are plotted for each variable against other variables including target variables.
##### 3. Model building
There are two different models built on the data.
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
##### 4. Model Evaluation
The models are tested for sensitivity and F-score
